# Week 1

### Title: Ruby Email value object

### Problem statement
Write a program in Ruby that implements the Email class. The objects of these class should be treated as value objects.
There should be validations in place and it should throw error if we try to initialize an invalid email
You can implement more helper methods like host, domain etc.
The object should behave like a string (Hint: [override `to_str`](https://kddnewton.com/2021/09/09/ruby-type-conversion.html#to_str))
