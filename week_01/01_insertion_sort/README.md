# Week 1

### Title: Insertion sort

### Problem statement

Write a program in Ruby that implements the insertion sort algorithm

### Comments/Description/Learnings

Test your solution by running `ruby week_01/01_insertion_sort/test.rb`

Insertion sort works by taking elements from the unsorted list and inserting them at the correct position in the sorted list.

The key you select is started at position 1 and we move it into the sorted array by shifting all elements greater than the key in the sorted list to the right

The average case time complexity of Insertion sort is O(N^2) The time complexity of the best case is O(N). The space complexity is O(1)
