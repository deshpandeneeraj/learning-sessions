### Title: Insertion sort

### Problem statement
Write a program in Ruby that implements the insertion sort algorithm

### Comments/Description/Learnings
Insertion sort works by taking elements from the unsorted list and inserting them at the correct position in the sorted list.

The key you select is started at position 1 and we move it into the sorted array by shifting all elements greater than the key in the sorted list to the right
