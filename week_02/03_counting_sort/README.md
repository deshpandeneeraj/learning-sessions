### Title: Counting sort

### Problem statement
Write a program to implement the counting sort algorithm

### Comments/Description/Learnings
Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well when there is limited range of input values. It is particularly efficient when the range of input values is small compared to the number of elements to be sorted. The basic idea behind Counting Sort is to count the frequency of each distinct element in the input array and use that information to place the elements in their correct sorted positions.


- Try counting sort with hash
- Try with cumulative sum to make it stable
- Use objects with name, age, sorted by name first and then sort by age using counting sort
