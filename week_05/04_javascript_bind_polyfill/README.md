A polyfill provides the functions and features that the developer expects the browser to offer by default.

Poly means that it could be solved using a wide range of techniques it wasnâ€™t limited to just being done using JavaScript, and fill would fill the gap in the browser where the technology was needed. Polyfill can be seen as a material that fills the voids and cracks to smooth out any imperfections.
