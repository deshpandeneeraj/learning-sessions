### Title: Merge sort

### Problem statement
Write a program in Ruby that implements a hash table
```ruby
class CustomHash
  def initialize
    buckets
  end

  # O(1)
  def get(key)      
  end

  # O(1)
  def set(key, number)
  end
end
```
### Comments/Description/Learnings
A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored
